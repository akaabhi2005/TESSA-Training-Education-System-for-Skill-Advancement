"""Conversational intake: free text in, structured constraints out.

Extraction here is deliberately domain-blind. It does not know what skills
exist, because at this point nothing does - the skill graph is derived from the
goal afterwards (engines/goal.py). So intake captures three things:

  * the goal, in the learner's own words, passed through untouched
  * hard constraints - hours a week, weeks available, budget, format
  * whatever they claimed to already know, as raw phrases

Those phrases get snapped onto the derived graph later, in `snap`, once there
is a graph to snap them onto. Keeping the two steps apart is what lets the
system take a goal in any domain: the extractor never needs a vocabulary.

There is a keyword fallback for when no model is available. It cannot derive a
graph - nothing can, without a model - but it gets the constraints right, which
is enough to keep the intake conversation moving and to reuse a cached goal.

  goal_text        their goal, rewritten as one clear sentence in their own
                   terms. Do not generalise a specific goal into a job title:
                   "build a Rust game engine" must not become "software
                   engineer". If they named a role, keep the role.
  known_skills     raw phrases for things they said they already know or use.
                   Their words, not a taxonomy. Include the qualifier they used
                   - "basic Python", "five years of SQL", "some React".
  weekly_hours     only if stated. Never infer it from enthusiasm.
  horizon_weeks    only if stated. Convert months to weeks.
  time_unconstrained true only when they explicitly say there is no deadline,
                   no time constraint, or that the timeline is open-ended.
  budget           free / freemium / paid, only if they indicated one.
  format_prefs     video / text / interactive / project, only if indicated.
  motivation       job_switch / promotion / curiosity / academic, if clear.

  confidence       0-1, how complete this is. Below 0.7 you must set
                   follow_up_question to the single most useful thing to ask
                   next: the goal first if it is vague, then current experience,
                   then time available. "Complete beginner", "no experience",
                   and "starting from scratch" answer the experience question.
                   An open-ended timeline answers the time-window question.
                   One question, conversational, and never one they have
                   already answered.

A goal you have never heard of is not a problem. Record it faithfully.
