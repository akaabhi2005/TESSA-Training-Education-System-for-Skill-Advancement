"""Path generation. This is the part that is not a language model.

Three stages:

  1. Selection - which courses. Covering a weighted skill gap under an hours
     budget is budgeted maximum coverage. The objective is submodular, so the
     greedy "best marginal coverage per hour" rule has the standard 1-1/e
     guarantee. That is good enough and it runs in milliseconds.

  2. Ordering - what order. Build the induced prerequisite DAG over the chosen
     courses and topologically sort it, breaking ties by difficulty then by how
     urgent the skill is. Because the order comes out of the DAG, a path can
     never put a course before its prerequisite. Prerequisite violations are
     zero by construction, not by luck, and the eval notebook checks it.

  3. Shaping - milestones, projects, assessments. Bucket the ordered list by
     the learner's weekly hours, then close each phase with a project and a
     checkpoint over exactly the skills that phase taught.

Deliberately no LLM in here. The planner has to be deterministic or we cannot
test it, and "the model chose the order" is not an explanation anyone can
audit.
